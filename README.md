# House-Price-Prediction_Miuul

## Business Problem
Using a dataset containing the features and prices of various houses, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on different property characteristics.

## Dataset Description
This dataset consists of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and includes 79 explanatory variables that describe different aspects of the houses. The dataset was part of a Kaggle competition, where participants were required to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

Since this dataset is from a Kaggle competition, it is provided in two separate CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `test.csv` file has missing house prices, which need to be predicted based on the given features.

For more details, you can visit the Kaggle competition page:

## Project Structure
- `data/` : Contains the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`)
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training
- `src/` : Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training
- `models/` : Saved trained models
- `README.md` : Project documentation

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Execute the training script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
